### Review structure

1. paper meta data (authors, conference/section, year, number of pages, etc.)
2. paper layout/sections
3. feedback in the context of:
	- problem statement (is research statement clear? does the problem sound relevant?)
	- innovation (does the work bring any innovation ideas or methods?)
	- contribution (what artifacts are produced by the work?)
	- logical correcteness (are there any irrational, controversial or incorrect statments or conclusions?)
	- proof of statements (are there any questional, unproven statments or conclusions?)
	- readablity (are the key ideas/methods clear? is the content easy to read and understand?)
4. any other notable points: what is good/interesting about the papers and what could be better.
